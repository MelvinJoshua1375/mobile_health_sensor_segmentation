# Mobile Health Sensor Segmentation Project

This repository contains:

- `Sensor_Segmentation.ipynb` — Full code of the Project using PySpark (run on Google Colab)
- `Mobile Health Sensor Segmentation - Melvin Joshua.pptx` — Presentation summarizing the Project

## Summary
This project delves into the analysis of mobile health data, encompassing sensor readings from various activities performed by multiple subjects, which is explored to uncover patterns and insights related to human movement and behaviour. PySpark, a powerful distributed computing framework, is employed for efficient data processing and manipulation. The project encompasses data cleaning, feature engineering, and clustering using the K-Means algorithm. Visualizations generated using matplotlib aid in understanding the distribution of activities, sensor readings, and their correlations. Outlier detection and imputation techniques are applied to ensure data quality. The findings of this analysis provide valuable insights into human activity recognition and can potentially contribute to the development of personalized health monitoring systems and applications.
